# GitHub Actions Setup Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure CI/CD is configured correctly.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Repository is on GitHub
- [ ] You have admin access to the repository
- [ ] GCP project is set up and functions are working
- [ ] You have `gcloud` CLI installed and authenticated

## Setup Steps

### 1. Run Setup Script
```bash
cd /Users/trilliumsmith/code/calendar-merge-service
./scripts/setup-github-actions.sh
```

- [ ] Script completed without errors
- [ ] Service account key created: `github-actions-key.json`
- [ ] IAM permissions granted
- [ ] Script printed 4 secrets to add to GitHub

### 2. Add GitHub Secrets

Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/settings/secrets/actions`

Click "New repository secret" for each:

- [ ] Added `GCP_PROJECT_ID`
- [ ] Added `GCP_REGION`
- [ ] Added `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`
- [ ] Added `GCP_SA_KEY` (entire JSON, including `{` and `}`)

### 3. Security Cleanup

- [ ] Verified all 4 secrets are in GitHub
- [ ] Deleted local key file: `rm github-actions-key.json`
- [ ] Confirmed `github-actions-key.json` is in `.gitignore`

### 4. Commit Workflow

```bash
git add .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "ci: add GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow"
git push origin main
```

- [ ] Workflow file committed
- [ ] Changes pushed to GitHub
- [ ] No secrets committed (check with `git log -p`)

### 5. Verify First Run

Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/actions`

- [ ] Workflow run appears
- [ ] Test job is running/passed
- [ ] Deploy job is running/passed (if on main branch)
- [ ] No errors in logs

### 6. Test on Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b test-ci
git commit --allow-empty -m "test: verify CI pipeline"
git push origin test-ci
```

- [ ] Test job runs on feature branch
- [ ] Deploy job is skipped (not main branch)
- [ ] Tests pass successfully

### 7. Test Auto-Deploy

```bash
git checkout main
git merge test-ci
git push origin main
```

- [ ] Test job runs
- [ ] Deploy job runs (only on main)
- [ ] Functions deployed to GCP
- [ ] Deployment logs show success

### 8. Verify Deployed Functions

```bash
gcloud functions list --regions=us-central1
```

- [ ] `handleWebhook` function listed
- [ ] `renewWatches` function listed
- [ ] Functions are in ACTIVE state
- [ ] Recent deploy time matches GitHub Actions timestamp

### 9. Optional: Branch Protection

Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/settings/branches`

Add rule for `main`:

- [ ] Require pull request before merging
- [ ] Require status checks to pass
- [ ] Require "test" check to pass
- [ ] Require branches to be up to date

### 10. Test Full Workflow

```bash
git checkout -b feature/test-full-workflow
# Make a small change
echo "# Test" >> test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "test: full CI/CD workflow"
git push origin feature/test-full-workflow
```

On GitHub:
- [ ] Create pull request
- [ ] Wait for tests to pass
- [ ] Merge pull request
- [ ] Verify automatic deployment
- [ ] Cleanup: `git branch -d feature/test-full-workflow`

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå Tests fail in CI but pass locally
```bash
# Run exactly as CI does
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

### ‚ùå Deploy job doesn't run
Check:
- [ ] Job is on `main` branch
- [ ] Test job passed first
- [ ] Not a pull request (only direct pushes to main)

### ‚ùå Deploy fails with "Permission Denied"
Re-run step 1 to grant IAM permissions:
```bash
./scripts/setup-github-actions.sh
```

### ‚ùå Deploy fails with "Invalid credentials"
Check:
- [ ] `GCP_SA_KEY` secret contains entire JSON (with `{` and `}`)
- [ ] No extra spaces or newlines in secret
- [ ] JSON is valid (paste into JSON validator)

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ All items checked above
‚úÖ Tests run automatically on every push
‚úÖ Deployment happens automatically on main branch
‚úÖ Functions are deployed and working
‚úÖ No secrets in git repository
‚úÖ Documentation is clear and accessible

## Post-Setup

Your workflow is now:
1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes
3. Push (tests run automatically)
4. Create PR
5. Merge to main (auto-deploy!)

No more manual deployments! üéâ
