# CI/CD Setup Summary

## What Was Created

### GitHub Actions Workflow
**File:** [`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`](.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml)

**Jobs:**
1. **Test Job** (runs on all pushes/PRs)
   - Install dependencies
   - Run tests
   - Build project
   - Verifies code quality

2. **Deploy Job** (runs only on main branch)
   - Requires tests to pass first
   - Authenticates to GCP
   - Deploys Cloud Functions
   - Only triggers on main branch pushes

### Setup Script
**File:** [`scripts/setup-github-actions.sh`](scripts/setup-github-actions.sh)

Automates:
- Creating GCP service account key
- Granting required IAM permissions
- Displaying GitHub secrets configuration

### Documentation
1. **[docs/github-actions-setup.md](docs/github-actions-setup.md)** - Complete setup guide
2. **[docs/CI-CD-QUICK-START.md](docs/CI-CD-QUICK-START.md)** - Quick reference
3. **[README.md](README.md)** - Updated with CI/CD section

## How To Use

### One-Time Setup

```bash
# 1. Run setup script
./scripts/setup-github-actions.sh

# 2. Copy the output to GitHub Secrets
# Go to: GitHub Repo → Settings → Secrets → Actions
# Add the 4 secrets printed by the script

# 3. Delete local key file (security)
rm github-actions-key.json

# 4. Commit and push
git add .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
git commit -m "ci: add GitHub Actions workflow"
git push
```

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# Make changes
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# Push (triggers tests automatically)
git push origin feature/my-feature

# Create PR on GitHub
# Merge PR (triggers auto-deployment)
```

## What Happens Automatically

### On Every Push/PR
```
Push code
  ↓
Install dependencies
  ↓
Run tests
  ↓
Build project
  ↓
✅ Success or ❌ Fail
```

### On Main Branch Push
```
Push to main
  ↓
Run tests
  ↓
Tests pass?
  ↓ Yes
Build functions
  ↓
Deploy to GCP
  ↓
✅ Deployed
```

## Security Features

✅ No credentials in code (all in GitHub Secrets)
✅ Service account keys not committed (in .gitignore)
✅ Branch protection possible (require tests before merge)
✅ Least privilege IAM permissions
✅ Automatic cleanup reminder for local keys

## Required GitHub Secrets

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | GCP project identifier |
| `GCP_REGION` | Cloud Functions region |
| `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` | Service account for deployments |
| `GCP_SA_KEY` | Service account credentials (JSON) |

## Files Modified

- ✅ `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- ✅ `scripts/setup-github-actions.sh` - Setup automation
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Added github-actions-key.json
- ✅ `README.md` - Added CI/CD section
- ✅ `docs/github-actions-setup.md` - Full documentation
- ✅ `docs/CI-CD-QUICK-START.md` - Quick reference

## Benefits

### Before CI/CD
- ❌ Manual testing before every deploy
- ❌ Manual deployment steps
- ❌ Risk of forgetting to test
- ❌ Inconsistent deployment process

### After CI/CD
- ✅ Automatic testing on every push
- ✅ Automatic deployment on merge to main
- ✅ Consistent, repeatable process
- ✅ Faster feedback loop
- ✅ Reduced human error

## Next Steps

1. **Run setup script** to create service account key
2. **Add secrets to GitHub** (repo settings)
3. **Push workflow file** to trigger first run
4. **Enable branch protection** (optional but recommended)
5. **Test with a small change** to verify workflow

## Monitoring

**View workflow runs:**
GitHub Repository → Actions tab

**View deployment logs:**
Click on workflow run → Click job → Expand steps

**View deployed functions:**
```bash
gcloud functions list --regions=us-central1
```

## Cost

**GitHub Actions:**
- Free: 2,000 minutes/month (private repos)
- Usage: ~5 minutes per push
- 20 pushes/month = 100 minutes (well within free tier)

**GCP:**
- No additional cost (same as manual deployment)

## Troubleshooting

See [docs/github-actions-setup.md](docs/github-actions-setup.md#troubleshooting) for:
- Permission issues
- Build failures
- Deployment errors
- Test failures
